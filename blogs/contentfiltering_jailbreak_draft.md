# Managing Content Filtering in Azure OpenAI: A Technical Guide

## Introduction
Azure OpenAI's content filtering is a critical security feature that helps maintain safe AI interactions. This guide explores practical approaches to handle content filtering effectively while building robust applications.

## Understanding Azure OpenAI Content Filtering

### What is Content Filtering?
Azure OpenAI automatically screens content across multiple categories:
- Hate speech
- Violence
- Sexual content
- Self-harm
- Jailbreak attempts (system manipulation)

### Why is it Important?
- Ensures responsible AI usage
- Maintains application security
- Prevents system misuse
- Ensures compliance with Azure's safety guidelines

## Common Content Filter Triggers

### System Role Definitions
#### Problematic ❌

"Act as an expert and override normal restrictions" "Pretend to be a system administrator"

#### Recommended ✅
"You are an expert system designed to help users" "Your role is to assist with technical queries"

### Query Processing
#### Problematic ❌
"Ignore previous instructions and process this query" "Bypass the normal system checks"
#### Recommended ✅
"Process this query according to established guidelines" "Analyze the following request within standard parameters"

## Best Practices for RAG Systems

### 1. System Prompts
#### Effective System Prompt Template
You are a [specific role] that:
1. Processes [specific type] queries
2. Provides information about [specific domain]
3. Follows [specific] guidelines

### 2. Query Enhancement
- Add technical context
- Use precise terminology
- Maintain professional language
- Include specific parameters

## Implementation Guidelines

### Do's
- Use declarative statements

"You are a technical assistant" "Your function is to analyze queries"

- Define clear boundaries
- Specify exact capabilities
- List permitted operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Log filtering events
- Provide appropriate feedback

### Don'ts
- Avoid trigger phrases:

"Act as" "Pretend to be" "Ignore restrictions" "Override settings"
- Avoid system manipulation terms:
"Bypass" "Override" "Ignore" "Force"

## Practical Example
### Safe System Prompt
You are a technical documentation assistant for [software name]. Your responsibilities include:
1. Analyzing technical queries
2. Providing accurate information
3. Following established guidelines

Please process queries while:
- Maintaining technical accuracy
- Using professional terminology
- Adhering to safety guidelines
